# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: It's a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Traditional programming is centered around just the code, software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software. It extends from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): This is a process used by teams to develope high quality, cost effective projects and within stipulated time frames. It is divided into six phases.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. This phases include 1:Requirements - Garhering and documenting user needs and system requirements. 2:Design - Creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface. 3:Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specification. 4:Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 5:Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers. 6:Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile emphasizes on flexibility,collaboration and customer feedback whereas waterfall is linear and sequential in approach and each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Agile is flexible while waterfall is linear. Agile is more preffered for long term projects while waterfall is prefferable for short term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Requirements engineering is a systematic process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirements for a system. The process  involves the following steps: requirements elicitation, analysis and negotiation, specification, validation and management. Importance of requirements engineering: 1 -Creates a foundation for system design and development. 2-It enhances stakeholder communication and satisfaction. 3-Helps in risk management and cost efficiency.
Software Design Principles: Single design principle, Open/closed pronciple, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle and Dependancy inversion principle.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity is a practice of dividing a software system into seperate, self contained units that are responsible for specific tasks in the system functionality. Modularity helps in enhancing maintenability by isolating changes, it also simplifies testing and improves code understanding, beacuse it ebables independent development and facilitates incremental growth it thus enhances scalability.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? Unit testing focuses on testing individual units of the software in isolation. Intergration testing verifies the interaction between different units of the software. System testing evaluates the entire software system as a whole against specifed requirements. Acceptance testing evaluates whether the software meets the customer's acceptance criteria and business requirements.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.They are software tools that help manage changes in a software project and keep track of every modification made to a code  allowing developers to collaborate, track progress and maintain history to the changes made. Importance;- Allow collaboration, tracking history, tracking versions of the software, supports branching and merging, allows backup and recovery, Allows reviewing the code, Room for parallel development and helps in troubleshooting issues and ensure consistency across different environments. Examples are: Git which is open-source, Subversion which follows a centralized version control model, Mercurial and Perforce.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? the key roles include; Planning and scheduling, managing the team, facilitates communication, identify and manage potential risks, overseeing quality of deliverables in the project, Responsible for managing project budgets and engage stakeholders and clients. major challenges include; Technical complexities, constraint in resources, change of project scope, communication issues, uncertain or changing requirements, risks involved with the project and managing client expectations.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Software maintenance is the process of modifying, updating, enhancing and managing software systems after they have been deployed to ensure their continues functionality, reliability and relevance throughout their lifecycle. Types of maintenance include; Corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Ethical issues faced include; Privacy and data security, Bias, Intellectual property rights, transparency and accountability, accessibility, social responsibility and professional integrity. Software engineers canadhere to ethical standards by: Staying informed through education and awareness, adhere to codes of conduct, make ethical decisions, through collaboration and consultation, practice transparency and accountability and through advocating for ethical practices.
